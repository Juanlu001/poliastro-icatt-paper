poliastro relies on well-tested, community-backed libraries for low level astronomical tasks, such as astropy\cite{Robitaille_2013} and jplephem. We comment the positive outcomes of the new open development strategies and the permissive, commercial-friendly licenses omnipresent in the scientific Python ecosystem.
