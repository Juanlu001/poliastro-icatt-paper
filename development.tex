\section{Development approach}
\label{sec:development}

Open source is no longer enough, and we argue it should be superseded by open development.

poliastro relies on well-tested, community-backed libraries for low level astronomical tasks, such as astropy\cite{Robitaille2013} and jplephem. We comment the positive outcomes of the new open development strategies and the permissive, commercial-friendly licenses omnipresent in the scientific Python ecosystem.

In fact, recent activity in this area suggests a shift from a mere publication of program sources to a complete process of developing in the open\footnote{https://speakerdeck.com/astrofrog/astropy-and-the-open-source-revolution-in-astronomy}\footnote{https://opendevelopmentmethod.org/} and the benefits of this approach to commercial development practices is being studied\footnote{http://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/}.
