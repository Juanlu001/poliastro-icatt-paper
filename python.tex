\section{Python as a core computational language}
\label{sec:python}

Python is a fast-growing language both for astronomic applications\cite{2015arXiv150703989M} and for educational purposes\cite{guo2014python}, but it is often criticized for its suboptimal performance and lack of type enforcement.

We accelerated the algorithms using numba and compared its performance with existing, publicly available Fortran implementations.
