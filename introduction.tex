\section{Introduction}

This is a test cite \cite{Ziemer_2012}. We implemented the algorithm outlined in \cite{Izzo_2014} for solving the Lambert problem, following also the developments of \cite{gooding1990procedure} and \cite{blanchard1969unified}. More info on sustainable scientific software development may be found on \cite{brown2015run}.
