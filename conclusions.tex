\section{Conclusions}

Some conclusions.

\footnotesize{\textit{Acknowledgements}. I am grateful to the Free and Open Source Community in general, and specially the developers that work on Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Jupyter and astropy. This extends to the people that make it possible to have free (as in freedom) operative systems, compilers, text editors, IDEs and browsers.

I also thank Helgee Eichhorn and Frazer McLean for their input, Alberto Lorenzo for his invaluable work on the Continuous Integration infrastructure and GMV for allowing me to prepare this article in working hours.

To conclude, I thank the European Commission, the Erasmus Programme and the Technical University of Madrid for allowing me to study one year at Politecnico di Milano, which sparked my passion for Astrodynamics and enrichened my vision of the world.
