\section{Conclusions}

Some conclusions.

\footnotesize{\textit{Acknowledgements}. I am grateful to the Free and Open Source Community in general, and specially the developers that work on Python, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Jupyter and astropy. All what I have learned about programming would not be possible without the tremendous, often unpaid and unrecognized effort of thousands of volunteers who devote a significant part of their lives to share their knowledge and produce top quality software. Apart from direct contributions, I have been lucky to use free (as in freedom) operative systems, compilers, text editors, IDEs and browsers for my whole academic life.

I also thank Helgee Eichhorn and Frazer McLean for their input, Alberto Lorenzo for his invaluable work on the Continuous Integration infrastructure and GMV for allowing me to prepare this article in working hours.

To conclude, I thank the European Commission, the Erasmus Programme and the Technical University of Madrid for allowing me to study one year at Politecnico di Milano, which sparked my passion for Astrodynamics and enrichened my vision of the world.
